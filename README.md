# Course_Site_Version1
Worked with a friend (Yue Han) to recreate a course site (the original website can be found at https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~bretscher/b20/). 
It contains the same information as the original site but in a more visually stunning and user friendly layout. Our site also uses flexbox to make it responsive. 

This repository contains all of the html and css files needed to access and use the website. 

Go to https://sara-naeem-cs.github.io/Course_Site_Version1/ to interact with the website. 

Hope you like it! :)
